# Persistence: Enable AOF for better durability (optional, but good for cache)
appendonly yes
appendfsync everysec

# The appendonly and appendfsync settings manage Redis’s persistence behavior.
# While Redis serves primarily as a cache, maintaining persistence prevents
# complete cache losses during server restarts.
# The everysec setting balances performance with data safety.

# Memory management (recommended for WordPress)
maxmemory 256mb
maxmemory-policy allkeys-lru

# The allkeys-lru maxmemory-policy ensures the most frequently accessed content stays in cache.

# save 900 1
# save 300 10
# save 60 10000
# The save directives control when Redis creates point-in-time snapshots of the dataset.
#     Every 15 minutes after one change.
#     Every five minutes after 10 changes.
#     Every minute after 10,000 changes.
